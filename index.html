                <p> My name is Antoinette Hall. I am 18 years old. I was born in England but moved to the USA when
                    I was 6. When I was 13, I moved to Taiwan where I attended high school. At 17, I graduated high
                    school and came to AUP where I am a second year Information Technology major. I enjoy sports 
                    I joined my high school varsity basketball team where I was captain for two years, and I ran track.
