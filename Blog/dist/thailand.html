                    <h5> April 2017 </h5>
                    <p>
                        My junior year in high school I had the opportunity to join a mission trip to Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand.
                        A group of 20 students and 4 teachers went to Ubon Adventist International Mission School to help
                        them build a cafeteria. For 10 days, we laid concrete and held a Vacation Bible School for the 
                        children in the nearby village. Some of the students were also teachers' assistants because some 
                        of the foreign teachers were on a visa run. It was a very enjoyable experience.

                    <h5> April 2018 </h5>
                    <p>
                        Senior year we went back to the same school in Thailand and helped them prepare for the opening
                        of their new school building. We painted the walls and a mural near the playground. Again we had 
                        Vacation Bible School but this time we did it with the children in the school. Besides working,
                        we went on a boat ride down the border of Thailand and Laos.
